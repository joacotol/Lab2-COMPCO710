            <p>Description:</p>

            <p>
                At first sight, Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you
                will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots -
                neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop
                assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the vicious
                coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents'
                Association. He will persist in making his daily inspection
                rounds of the local streets.
            </p>

            <p>
                But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned
                clarity of belief and deed? Such unswerving conviction about
                what the world should be, and a lifelong dedication to making it
                just so?

            <p>
                No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework
                for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's
                leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies
                that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad
                ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable
                results.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't
                you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves
                again and again not because you don't want to change, but
                because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to
                the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
                Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new
                heights.

                Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters
                start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive.
                Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple
                seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle.
                Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of
                a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news:
                Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School
                of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to
                begin!

            <p>Author: Jane Austen</p>
            <p>Description:</p>

            <p>
                Pride and Prejudice is a comedy of manners centered around the
                Bennet family, a family of five daughters where the parents are
                desperate for at least one of them to make a wealthy match and
                save the next generation from destitution. Austen's story
                engages with the tension between marrying for love, rather than
                wealth or social prestige, and the pressure to assure financial
                security. Originally published in 1813, Pride and Prejudice is
                one of the best-loved and best-selling novels in English
                literature of all time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jane Austen (1775-1817) was an English novelist known for her
                novels about the British landed gentry and the social, economic,
                and romantic pressures faced by young women. Her comic wit and
                use of irony and literary realism have given her novels
                remarkable staying power, remaining as relevant and meaningful
                to readers today as during her own time.

            <p>Description:</p>

            <p>
                J. Kenji López-Alt’s debut cookbook, The Food Lab,
                revolutionized home cooking, selling more than half a million
                copies with its science-based approach to everyday foods. And
                for fast, fresh cooking for his family, there’s one pan
                López-Alt reaches for more than any other: the wok.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether stir-frying, deep frying, steaming, simmering, or
                braising, the wok is the most versatile pan in the kitchen. Once
                you master the basics—the mechanics of a stir-fry, and how to
                get smoky wok hei at home—you’re ready to cook home-style and
                restaurant-style dishes from across Asia and the United States,
                including Kung Pao Chicken, Pad Thai, and San Francisco–Style
                Garlic Noodles. López-Alt also breaks down the science behind
                beloved Beef Chow Fun, fried rice, dumplings, tempura vegetables
                or seafood, and dashi-simmered dishes.
